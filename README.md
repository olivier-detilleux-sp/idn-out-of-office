# Outlook 365 Out Of Office with IDN

The purpose of those artifacts is to get the Out of Office status of mail enabled users in Office 365. This status can then be used as a logical test to forward approvals in IdentityNow.

With the new workflow feature and the loop operator, it is now possible, within IDN, to implement a workflow to forward pending approvals for out of office people

> Warning: Due to the current limitation of 50 iteration within a workflow loop Operator, the worfklow can only parse the first 50 pending access requests â€¦
